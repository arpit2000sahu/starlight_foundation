However, the village that I lived in did not have a school that offered secondary education. So, my sister and I moved to another village to live with our grandparents and continued our studies. I was in the 8th grade when I learned about CRY project PORD. As part of their door-to-door campaign, they invited me to join the children\u2019s collective in the colony too. I was an extremely shy person and didn\u2019t have the confidence to speak to anyone apart from my family. Though my grandparents were reluctant to let me join the children\u2019s collective, they eventually agreed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I joined the collective, I made sure I participated in every possible activity of the child collective. I found my calling when I learned about child rights and decided to help make more children aware of their rights. In two years, I started participating in capacity building programs and eventually became the Secretary of the children\u2019s collective. I even visited several schools to speak about children\u2019s rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I\u2019m pursuing my B. Tech in Computer Science Engineering. Thanks to my efforts in building awareness on children\u2019s rights in my community, I was selected as an Ashoka Youth Venturer. In the next five years, I aim to cover 500 schools and hostels and sensitize children and teachers on child protection and menstrual hygiene management!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Revathi the chance at a brighter future.
