According to UNICEF, 247 million children attending primary and secondary schools in India were affected by the coronavirus outbreak and the ensuing lockdowns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At CRY, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/\">top NGO in India<\/a>, we have been focusing on multiple channels to help close the education gap and prevent underprivileged children from permanently giving up on their education:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Certified teachers are teaching students in remote locations using digital tablets through the Bridge School programme. Tablets make learning easy and fun through a creative medium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. The teachers are also focusing on strengthening the basic reading, speaking, and writing skills of the students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Children are being assisted with their homework and worksheets to help boost their confidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Regularly monitoring and following up with every child to ensure they go to school as the school reopens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Reducing the vulnerability of girls to child marriage by counselling their parents and enrolling them back in school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Organising awareness rallies to mobilise the communities and enrolling back the children who dropped out of school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Focusing on extra-curricular activities through life skill sessions, singing, and dance classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. Conducting regular meetings with parents, communities, and school management to create a holistic ecosystem for the children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, CRY has 179 bridge learning centres in India that serve 24,919 children in 302 villages of 49 districts in 15 states.&nbsp;You can experience the joy of giving by supporting CRY&#8217;s Bridge School programme at this critical time to give India\u2019s children a chance at a brighter future. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/help-bridge-the-education-gap\/\">Help bridge the education gap<\/a>&nbsp;for more underprivileged children in India to pave their way towards a better future!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Children\u2019s education in India&nbsp;is extremely crucial.
