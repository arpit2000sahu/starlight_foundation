Mamta decided to&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in the initial group sessions&nbsp;being conducted&nbsp;for adolescent girls&nbsp;and was encouraged to take up the sport as a part of MJAS\u2019s life skills program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She went on to form the MJAS girls&#8217; football team and won many accolades&nbsp;across multiple&nbsp;tournaments&nbsp;including&nbsp;the &#8216;Sports for Change&#8217; tournament&nbsp;organized by&nbsp;HCL Foundation&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the&nbsp;state level sports festival conducted by the Rajasthan Government.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while her talent in football was earning her recognition, her father wasn\u2019t thrilled with the idea of a girl taking up a male-dominated sport like football. Her community raised concerns&nbsp;about girls playing in shorts&nbsp;and her team was often harassed during practice sessions by those who wanted them to stop playing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The girls were not deterred. They sought support from their mothers and, led by Mamta and her sister Sapna, continued honing their skills on the football field \u2013 determined to show their community that girls could not only play football but also bring pride to their community as sportswomen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their efforts and persistence bore fruit \u2013 the tournaments they won became a way to break gender stereotypes and their hard work earned them multiple scholarships to continue their education;&nbsp;Mamta herself passed the higher secondary examination with 1st division marks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of MJAS\u2019s adolescent girls&#8217; group, she also consistently raises awareness for ensuring that schools have enough teachers and quality education is accessible to all children; including girls. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, inspired by her story, Google selected her as a Google Women Icon \u2013 a milestone that is a testament to everything she has done to change patriarchal norms and enable girls in her community to rise to their truest potential! &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As CRY, we dream of a day when more children like Mamta are able to shine bright and make the nation proud.
