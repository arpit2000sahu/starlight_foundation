With lowered immunity due to such malnutrition and the lack of access to hygiene supplies and healthcare facilities, they are even more vulnerable to this disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At&nbsp;<a href=\"\/\">CRY<\/a>, we\u2019ve jumped into action to ensure that the communities we serve stay safe by distributing hygiene kits and dry rations in addition to spreading awareness on preventative measures and available medical facilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our Relief Response<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/crys-response-to-pandemic.jpg\" alt=\"Scale of Impact\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our tactical relief intervention has been focusing on 3 key areas with the aim to impact 3.5 lakh underprivileged children and their families:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dry Rations:<\/strong>&nbsp;Includes cereal, dal, oil, sugar, salt, potatoes, and soy chunks to ensure basic nutrition for children and their families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hygiene Kits:<\/strong>&nbsp;Includes soaps, sanitizers, face masks, gloves, sanitary napkins, and study materials in addition to protective gear and disinfectant supplies for government healthcare workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Awareness Generation:<\/strong>&nbsp;About preventative measures, recommended hygiene practices, and information about available medical facilities and government schemes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Status On Disbursals<\/strong><img src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Disbursal-Status.png\" alt=\"Disbursal Status\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/Disbursal-Status.png 939w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Disbursal-Status-300x166.png 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Disbursal-Status-768x426.png 768w\" width=\"939\" height=\"521\"\/>As of 17th August, 2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Going The Extra Mile<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over and above our direct relief measures, CRY project teams and volunteers have been mobilizing communities and authorities alike, with the help of our partners and supporters, to take action for children at every level and ensure that relief packages reach the most marginalized families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick snapshot of the impact we\u2019ve been able to create:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Migrant Worker Support<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Helped migrant workers re-register with the PDS system and ensuring that their children are re-registered with Anganwadis and the education system as well.<\/li><li>Initiated the screening of migrant workers in Bihar, Karnataka<strong>, <\/strong>and&nbsp;Odisha.<\/li><li>Advocated with the mayor and joint commissioner to ensure that migrant families in Mumbai and Bangalore urban slums received dry rations.<\/li><li>Advocated with the Gram Panchayat to establish a quarantine centre with 50 beds for returning migrants in Kandhamal district, Odisha.<\/li><li>Supported 202 migrant labourers in Maharashtra with cash transferred to their bank accounts.<\/li><li>Advocated with village Panchayats to enable 809 families in Uttar Pradesh and 1575 families in Chhattisgarh to find work under MNREGA and NTFP.<\/li><li>CRY projects spread awareness amongst 400 migrant laborers  from West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. <\/li><li>Prepared a database of migrant workers from West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar and shared it with the district administration for the provision of transportation to their native homes in Madhya Pradesh.<\/li><li>Collaborated with the Indo-Myanmar Friendship Labour Association to make a list of 131 migrant workers from Bihar and West Bengal in Manipur and shared it with the district authorities and MASLSA for their support.<\/li><li>Advocated with the district government to make provisions for quarantine and health check-ups for migrant laborers as well as buckets, mugs, bed sheet, pillow, and sanitizer for daily use during the quarantine period.<\/li><li>Supported migrant families in Karnataka, whose habitation was burnt by the land mafias, while the migrants were heading to the village, with dry ration for a month.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hygiene &amp;
