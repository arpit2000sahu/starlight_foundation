This day highlights the hard work and dedication of volunteers who contribute their time and energy to help make a difference in society. The occasion also sheds light on the urgent requirement of having more people join in and support non-profit organizations in their efforts to run impact-oriented programs for underprivileged communities.\n\nWe, at CRY, are overwhelmed by the generous contribution of self-motivated individuals who put in dedicated efforts&nbsp;towards ensuring happier childhoods&nbsp;by participating in a diverse range of volunteering opportunities. From raising funds for CRY&nbsp;and&nbsp;volunteering locally or virtually&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;participating in the Child Rights Leaders Program&nbsp;to&nbsp;raise&nbsp;awareness&nbsp;and&nbsp;becoming a CRY intern, we have people from all walks of life support underprivileged children&nbsp;in every way they can.\n\nVolunteers at CRY, an&nbsp;<a href=\"\/\">NGO for children<\/a>, have a transformational learning experience that helps them make a real difference&nbsp;in&nbsp;the lives of marginalized children across India.&nbsp;We are proud to share that in 2019-20, our volunteer team comprising of 2,793 volunteers, 360 remote volunteers, 1010 interns, and 27 child rights leaders raised INR 85,55,251 to create happier childhoods for India\u2019s marginalized children.\n\nWe&nbsp;look forward to have&nbsp;more kind-hearted individuals join CRY&nbsp;as volunteers and&nbsp;support our efforts to reach&nbsp;vulnerable&nbsp;children across the length and breadth of India.\n\nWe believe our volunteers are our #EverydayHeroes and we celebrate them today and every day for everything they do for children.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you are a passionate go-getter&nbsp;and&nbsp;want to contribute to India\u2019s growth while embarking upon the road to self-discovery,&nbsp;<a href=\"\/volunteering-and-internships\/\">volunteer with CRY&nbsp;<\/a>!","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>International Volunteer Day is celebrated on the 5th of December to express gratitude for the work they do.
