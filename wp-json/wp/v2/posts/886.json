As the daughter of a sex worker, people would call me names and expect me to get into the sex trade as well. It made me feel really bad \u2013 as if my dreams had no value. I had to drop out of school to become a child labourer when I was only 15 years old because that was the only way I could support my family without getting into prostitution. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would have given up on the idea of building a brighter future for myself if my mother hadn\u2019t taken me to CRY project SANLAAP. The CRY team counseled me and my mother on how it was important for me to finish my education and that\u2019s when I decided to leave my job and go back to school. I did really well in school and got admission at EDUSOL to study hotel management and also discovered my talent for Kung Fu! Last year, I won a gold medal at the National Kung Fu Championship in Guwahati!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve made myself and my family so proud and I couldn\u2019t be happier! So many people are telling me that I am an inspiration for other children like me. Today, I dream of flying high and touching the sky!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Payal the chance at a brighter future.
