However, in a country like ours, plagued by illiteracy, poverty and lack of access to resources, it could create a digital divide and consequently, the underprivileged communities may be left out of the vaccination drive. This could be further compounded by&nbsp;the lack of awareness and superstition associated with vaccines and could threaten mass vaccination initiatives. Hence vaccine hesitancy is a big fight that we need to fight.&nbsp;That\u2019s we worked on multiple mediums to help improve the situation, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Online Medium<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We conducted a webinar on the importance of vaccination and Covid prevention across the state of Karnataka.<\/li><li>Online sessions in the Marathi language was conducted to raise awareness among the community in Latur and Nanded district of Maharashtra.<\/li><li>We also conducted one-to-one counselling over the phone in Haryana with the community members who are hesitant to get vaccinated.<\/li><li>IVR programs have been running through Mobile Vaani in Odisha, wherein interview speeches from government hospitals are aired.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Door-to-Door Visits<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The CRY team organized door-to-door campaigns to generate awareness for vaccination and dispel myths.

Before Muharram he was not vaccinated which made him vulnerable to Covid 19. However, before the start of Muharram, vaccination awareness was carried out at Imam Bara and he was motivated by the program implementing team to undergo vaccination. Consequently, he along with his wife and mother were vaccinated before Muharram.&nbsp; His ailing mother was thus vaccinated against any vulnerability arising from Covid 19.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Highlights of Persistent Efforts in Minimising Covid Vaccine Hesitancy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Jhengnadihi village under Bhengrajpur Panchayat is 12 km from Paikmal block and 105 km from district headquarter Bargarh district in Odisha. Most of the marginal community resides there and rely on agriculture and daily wages. The vaccination turn up percentage was completely nil due to fear and stigma regarding Covid-19.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>CRY project workers intervened in the situation and carried out several home visits along with ANM, AWW, ASHA and convinced people for vaccination. They also organized village meetings in Jhengnadihi and explained details against the stigma and myths related to the Covid-19 vaccination to the community with the help of various IECs.<br \/><br \/>Currently more than 75% people are vaccinated (out of total vaccination age groups) in this village and remaining 25% will be vaccinated in the next few days.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The adolescent groups from TamodarRanda in Latur district took a path-breaking initiative to undergo vaccination awareness and curb the myths surrounding it within their community. They conducted one-to-one interviews with parents and neighbors to understand the reasons for apprehension for not administering vaccination. Once they understood the issue, they started visiting the households of those who have taken the vaccination, these people along with the girls interacted with other community members and raised awareness for vaccination. They made them understand that the vaccination will increase their resistance and develop immunity in the body against Covid. Slowly but steadily, these girls met more and more adults in the community and their persistent efforts in driving for vaccination led to their village being highlighted as the most vaccinated village in their area.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Breaking the Covid Vaccination Myth<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Zoona Begum, 56, resides in Gund Ibrahim, Pattan with her four children and husband. One of her neighbors, belonging in the same age group, had contracted Coronavirus this year and faced severe health complications that were nearly fatal. Sensing the gravity of the situation and the threat imposed by the pandemic, she wanted her family to be vaccinated but could not afford the costs of paid vaccination -her husband being a daily wage laborer. The vaccination campaign started through the advocacy of JKASW in Pattanthat benefitted many underprivileged families, including Zoonaand her family. She was vaccinated in the first week of July after being counselled by the program implementation team of JKASW. Today, she and her family are vaccinated with less vulnerability for Covid-19.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Mrs.Endrapati Sowmya, aged 26, is a resident of Chinnapuram, blessed with two children. Her husband is an agricultural labour who believed in the myths surrounding Covid vaccine. He didn\u2019t get vaccinated and was not allowing his wife to get vaccinated, even though Sowmya was interested in taking the vaccine. He even threatened his wife not to vaccinate due to fear and gossips that he heard. This matter was brought to the notice of the ICDS teacher who then visited Sowmya\u2019s house. She counselled her husband and motivated both of them to take vaccines and busted the myths surrounding it. Finally she was able to convince them and both the husband and wife&nbsp; got vaccinated during the Covid mega vaccination drive in CRASA intervention area (Andhra Pradesh).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking into Psycho-Social Well-Being Post Covid<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A 15 week life skill module has been introduced for the&nbsp; psychosocial well-being for children\/adolescents in the intervention across all states in East to ensure overall mental well-being of children and to cope up with the new normal post covid situation.<\/li><li>#Porashunodarabeyna \/ # shikshyaNahiRukegi &#8211; An online education to deprived children of the slums of the Kolkata in collaboration with CRY, Kolkata Police and Airtel was launched.
