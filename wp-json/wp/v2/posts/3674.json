It is an integral occasion to promote and celebrate children\u2019s rights, thus leading to dialogue and action that will build a better world for children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help fuel the conversation around children\u2019s rights, we launched the award-winning #YellowFellow campaign that aims to mobilize citizens to raise awareness for every child\u2019s right to a happier childhood. Launched in 2018, the campaign encourages the public to show their support for India\u2019s children by becoming a #YellowFellow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initiative is quite exciting as all it requires is for you to wear\/use a pair of yellow socks in any which way you\u2019d like \u2013 it just has to be creative and unique. You can then capture it, post the picture on all your social media handles, tag CRY, and use the hashtag #YellowFellow. Another fun way to do this is to use CRY\u2019s exclusive #YellowFellow augmented reality photo filters on <a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3ayuLXw\">Facebook<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/2YOtRDO\">Instagram<\/a>. The concept behind using socks is their association with childhood. It denotes the urgency of standing up for children who are deprived and make earnest efforts to help them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are grateful to share that the campaign has reached 1.7 crore people across India so far. Over 2300 people have excitedly participated, including 73 celebrities and influencers. CRY has also successfully broken the Guinness World Record in November 2018 for the maximum number of people wearing yellow sock puppets as CRY #YellowFellows in a single location! The #YellowFellow initiative also won an award for the \u2018Best Multi-Channel Campaign By An NGO\u2019 at the MCube Awards 2019. The campaign has become one of the most talked-about social campaigns and your efforts can take it further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a leading <a href=\"\/\">NGO for children<\/a>, we have created happier childhoods for over 3 million underprivileged children in the last 41 years!
