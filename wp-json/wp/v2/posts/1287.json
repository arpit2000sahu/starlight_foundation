We may not have gone to school but both of us wish for Dev to be educated and do well in life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were so excited to get him admitted to a private school under the EWS (Economically Weaker Sections) category. But then, the school authorities informed us that only the tuition fees would be waived and that we&#8217;d need to pay for books, uniforms, stationery, and other items. It was heartbreaking because we didn&#8217;t have the money to be able to do so. That&#8217;s when the CRY project Matrisudha came to help &#8211; they presented the Directorate of Education circular to the school which paved the way for us to get Dev admitted free of cost!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Dev loves his school and comes back home every day with a sack full of stories. We&#8217;re over the moon and hope that one day, our son will have a much brighter future!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8211; Dev&#8217;s father, Delhi<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Dev the chance at a brighter future.
