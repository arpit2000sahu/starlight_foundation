While Child Rights and You (CRY) has been known to be one of India\u2019s most trusted NGOs for over 4 decades now, we have once again proven our mettle by receiving the prestigious GuideStar India Platinum certification. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GuideStar India is India\u2019s largest and most reliable NGO information repository. GuideStar India Platinum is a seal issued after thorough due diligence of an organization for legal &amp; financial compliances and a certification that the organization is transparent and holds itself accountable to not just its stakeholders but also to the general public. It is a review based on facts presented by the NGO and verified against documents issued by regulatory authorities, statutory auditors, past donors and key visitors or memberships\/accreditations with philanthropic intermediaries. It is additionally based on the organization making detailed disclosures in the GuideStar India template for disclosures in the public domain based on Credibility Alliance norms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its inception, CRY has been focused on not just bringing happier childhoods to India\u2019s underprivileged children, but doing so in a reliable and transparent manner that inspires confidence amongst its donors and supporters. The GuideStar Platinum certification is a further testament to CRY\u2019s dedication towards its legacy of being India\u2019s most trusted NGO.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Transparency and credibility are the two hallmarks that NGOs are measured by when one wants to support a social cause.
