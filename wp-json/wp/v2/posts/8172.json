You can begin the festivities on a kind note by donating on this Diwali to make a difference in the lives of India&#8217;s underprivileged children. While this year has been difficult for all of us, children have been the unseen victims of the crisis and need our attention. The loss of livelihood of people along with the disruption of education, primary healthcare centres and midday meal schemes, have left children to struggle both mentally and physically. A lot of them are forced into child labour and child marriage during the pandemic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we prepare for festivities, we can make these underprivileged children a part of our celebrations by giving them the gift of health nutrition and education that they need the most right now. Our team at CRY is working to bring a change in their lives by focusing on &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Health &amp; Nutrition<\/strong><br \/>Protecting children from malnutrition, ensuring immunization of children on time, and raising awareness about menstrual hygiene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Safety &amp; Protection<\/strong><br \/>Addressing the rising cases of child labour, child marriage and trafficking to strengthen child protection mechanisms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Education<\/strong><br \/>Provide students with digital support and community-based learning activities in small groups to ensure continuity of education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, we can take a step forward and light up the lives of these children. Your donation this festive season can help children have a chance at getting better education and healthcare. So go ahead and choose a gift to support a cause of your choice. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/donate-on-this-diwali\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Donate on this Diwali<\/a> to create a lasting impact in the lives of India&#8217;s underprivileged children.
