But after many months of struggle, formal learning has finally resumed in schools. Unfortunately, many children who were enrolled in schools prior to the lockdown are unable to continue their education. This is because many of them dropped out during the gap when the schools were shut. As classrooms shifted to online mode, many underprivileged children could not continue learning as they didn\u2019t have access to digital devices. Some children from marginalised communities dropped out to support their families to stay afloat during the unforeseeable effects of the pandemic. And several others were married off early to ease the financial burden, thus making it impossible for them to return to their studies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Indias-Children-Go-Back-To-School.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11417\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The long gap in structured learning has made students lose interest in their studies. This is why the years to come are even more crucial to preserve and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/why-children\/\"><u>protect child rights<\/u><\/a>. It&#8217;s critical to provide integral tools and resources to get underprivileged children ready for classroom learning.
