The corporate can choose the project according to their geographical requirements and area of interest. CRY will direct and monitor the project as well as offer technical support and regularly share impact reports.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n \t<li><strong> Corporate Donations\n<\/strong>A corporate can directly make a donation that shall be put towards any of the children\u2019s causes that CRY works for. The lump-sum donation will help create a long-term impact and increase the\u00a0number of\u00a0beneficiaries\u00a0impacted\u00a0too.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n \t<li><strong> Cause Related Marketing\n<\/strong>Corporates\u00a0can partner with CRY\u00a0on\u00a0cause-related marketing\u00a0campaigns. This initiative will\u00a0aid\u00a0the company&#8217;s\u00a0brand objectives\u00a0and also build solid goodwill for their\u00a0brand.\u00a0Collaborating with\u00a0CRY will go a long way in showing the company\u2019s commitment to champion non-profits that are doing impactful work.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n \t<li><strong> Donation Boxes\n<\/strong>Corporates\u00a0can place donation boxes in its office premises or retail outlets so that the employees or their customers\/visitors can donate to support CRY. A physical donation box will also be a testament to the company\u2019s efforts to raise funds for a noble cause.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n \t<li><strong> Employee Engagement\n<\/strong>Corporate\u00a0employees\u00a0can be provided with\u00a0a wonderful opportunity to\u00a0make a difference. Starting with payroll giving,\u00a0where they can contribute a certain amount from their monthly salary towards CRY\u2019s programs,\u00a0corporates\u00a0can encourage their employees further by pledging to match the donation amount that its employees extend.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CSR implementation is a great way to support a non-profit organization.
