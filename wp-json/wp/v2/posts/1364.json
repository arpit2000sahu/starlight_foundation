This is a staggering number in a nation that is known to be making path-breaking achievements in many fields like technology and science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children are the future of every nation and they deserve to be looked after in the best possible manner. There is a severe lack of regular, healthy and nutritious meals that all children must receive every single day. Proper food and nutrition help in their physical as well as mental growth. But the deprivation leads to children becoming anaemic and underweight, thus making malnutrition in India an unresolved reality. National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015-16 states that 59% of the children under 5 years of age are anaemic while 36% of the children under 5 years of age are underweight. These unfortunate statistics reflect that many children need to be extended basic resources for their overall development, right from the time they are born. From medical care for regular check-ups to awareness among parents, children need to receive these resources for their well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As CRY, we work toward ensuring that there is access to quality medical facilities for children as currently, 47 out of every 1000 children do not live to see their first birthday. CRY has impacted over 3 million children who are vulnerable but the fight is far from won as India has the highest number of malnourished children in the world, adding to 42.8 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/donation\/\">Donate to CRY<\/a> and give the gift of health to children hailing from marginalized communities.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World Health Day is celebrated on the 7th of April to spread awareness on the importance of maintaining good health. 1 in every 3 children in India is suffering from malnutrition.
