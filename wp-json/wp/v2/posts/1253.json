We are 4 brothers and 4 sisters and we all had to drop out of school and work as child laborers to keep the family afloat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ma would go away for days to work as a daily wage laborer in the city as well. Life was really tough! I was quite good in studies but after having to drop out in the 2nd grade, my dream of becoming a doctor slowly started to fade away. Ma was sad about this but what could we do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s when CRY opened an Anganwadi in our village. The teachers came home and convinced my mother that my siblings and I should learn, not earn. I realized that education is the only way I\u2019d be able to build a better life for myself. Today, I\u2019m back in school and my teachers are helping me bridge the gap that I face due to all the years I lost. I study in the 6th standard and dream of the day I\u2019ll become a doctor and make my mother proud!\u201d \u2013 Mona*, Kotra District (Udaipur)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Mona the chance at a brighter future.
