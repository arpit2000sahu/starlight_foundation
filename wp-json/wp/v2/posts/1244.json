CRY then raised the issue at a community level as well as with the school in question \u2013 thanks to this intervention; the girls were not only provided books and uniforms but also enrolled into secondary school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, they are on the path to fulfilling their dreams!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more such children the chance at a brighter future.
