Her village had no electricity and she was left with little time to study during the day, in danger of dropping out of school completely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rinjhu&#8217;s story took a positive turn when the CRY project DEEP visited her village. Both Rinjhu and her family members were counseled about the necessity of attending school regularly and pursuing higher studies. After overcoming initial hurdles like making up for domestic chores, fear of personal security, and a rough terrain leading up to the school \u2013 Rinjhu finally resumed her education and was enrolled in a DEEP-run coaching center for free to help her make up for the lost time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say a child\u2019s potential just needs the right opportunity. So was the case with Rinjhu too \u2013 thanks to CRY\u2019s intervention, she cleared her board exams with flying colors!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Rinjhu is pursuing her higher education by attending secondary school, even though that means that she has to travel for almost 7 km on her bicycle every day. Rinjhu dreams of becoming a teacher and helping more children like her achieve their dreams too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Rinjhu the chance at a brighter future.
