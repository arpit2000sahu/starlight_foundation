Faced with a severe lack of infrastructural facilities and employment opportunities, they\u2019re often unable to give priority to their children\u2019s education. A first generation learner, with four elder siblings who had dropped out of school before 6th grade, Sneha was often tasked with household chores that left her with little time to study. To support her family\u2019s income, she also had to work on the weekends as a manual worker at construction sites. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sneha was in 10th grade when she failed her board exams. A failed result is usually the last straw in breaking the parental investment in the child\u2019s education and as was the case with other adolescents in her community, Sneha too dropped out of school. It would have been the end of the road for her dreams and ambitions, had CRY not intervened to change her story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Field staff from CRY project GSS regularly visited Sneha\u2019s house to counsel her and her family on the importance of an education and how it could pave the way for her financial independence. After many such visits, she finally agreed to retake her board exams with her parents\u2019 support and this time, cleared with flying colours! CRY also linked her to available government schemes and scholarships to ensure that continuing her education did not place extra burden on her family\u2019s situation. Sneha went on to complete her schooling and developed an interest in local textiles. Today, she is a proud college student studying textile design in Bhuj. Kutch has a rich culture of textiles and Sneha has a bright future ahead of her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sneha\u2019s story is an important one because for many children from underprivileged backgrounds, a small failure often signals the end of their chances of having a better future. Timely intervention and steady encouragement is necessary to help them persevere. At CRY, we dream of a day when every child will be able to harness their true potential and make our country proud!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Sneha the chance at a brighter future.
