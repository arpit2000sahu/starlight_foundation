She and her school-mates faced acute unavailability of drinking water as there were no functional hand pumps in school. This shortage of water created a lot of distress among the children and had an adverse impact on their ability to study.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The children raised this issue in a meeting conducted by Bal Manch, a forum created by CRY project AIM, to facilitate a dialogue between children and local leaders. One of the major impacts of the Bal Manch is that it enables children to come together and voice issues that impact them. Determined to solve the problem, Chandni led her friends to lock the school gate and stage a silent protest together, and the children requested the headmaster to repair the hand pump<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headmaster and a teacher promised the children that they will take steps to solve the water problem and the hand pump was repaired within ten days!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CRY mobilizes children into groups and builds leadership and problem-solving skills among them, empowering a cadre of leaders that solve issues affecting children. Chandni is a shining example of such a young leader, and we&#8217;re so proud of her!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Chandni a chance at a brighter future.
