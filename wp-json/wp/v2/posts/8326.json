It builds their knowledge, nurtures their capabilities, and improves their life skills, including emotional and social abilities. Education is the foundation for cognitive thinking and overall personal development. Hence it is crucial to focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/blog\/non-profit-organization-that-helps-in-educating-underprivileged-children-in-india\/\">children\u2019s education in India<\/a> &#8211; ensuring all children in our country have access to regular and quality education by attending a school and completing their education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Coronavirus crisis and the resultant lockdowns impacted 247 million children* enrolled in elementary and secondary schools in India. The pandemic kept children<strong> <\/strong>out of school for more than 18 months thus creating hurdles in their aspirations to complete their school education. This long gap has led to children losing their touch with school subjects and habits of structured learning, increasing their risk of dropping out of school. It has also increased their susceptibility to economic exploitation, sexual abuse, physical violence, trafficking, and early marriage. (*Source: UNICEF)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team at CRY, India\u2019s top NGO, is working hard to bridge the education gap so that children from underserved communities do not discontinue their education permanently. Through the Bridge School initiative, we are helping qualified teachers conduct classes for children in rural areas with the help of digital tablets. The content of the sessions is linked to the standard specific curriculum and lessons of the relevant State syllabus. These study sessions will be continued to supplement the school teaching and help ease children back into the routine of school. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we get closer to the holiday season, your generosity towards children in need can be a wonderful way to kick off the celebrations.
