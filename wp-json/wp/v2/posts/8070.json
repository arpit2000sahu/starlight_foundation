This occasion is marked to spread awareness about the girl child and the need to protect her, and also about the many disparities that are still practised among children based on their gender. Based on RGI Census 2016 and UDISE data 2016-17, around 38% of girls in India, between 15-18 years, are out of school. The girl child has so much potential but is still held back, be it with regards to proper healthcare or nutrition, regular education or safety and protection, girls in India are still not given equal opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Underprivileged girls are not enrolled in schools or asked to drop out early on due to multiple reasons, including financial constraints, long-distance to schools, lack of safe and easily available transportation facilities to schools, child marriage, child labour to ease the family\u2019s financial burden, household chores, and even sibling care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to McKinsey Gender Parity Study 2018, if all girls complete their education and join the workforce, it could add $770 billion to India\u2019s GDP by 2025. But the reality is far from this inspiring statistic. This is why we, at CRY, have been working tirelessly to bring a change in the lives of underprivileged girls by focusing on preventing them from permanently discontinuing their education. We are also ensuring proper nutrition and hygiene requirements for adolescent girls and spreading awareness to protect girls from abuse, violence and exploitation. Let\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/help-young-girls-complete-their-education\">support the girl child in India<\/a> and save them from the vicious cycle of poverty. We must invest in India\u2019s daughters to give them a chance at a brighter future. Donate to CRY NGO and help young girls complete their secondary education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this International Day of Girl Child, we want to urge you to join hands to help build a world for our girls where they will have endless opportunities to achieve their dreams. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/blog\/importance-of-girl-child-education-in-india\/\">Education of the girl child<\/a> is important and your generous donation can help girls have access to quality education to succeed in life.
