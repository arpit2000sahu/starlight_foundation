The girl child is still a victim of discrimination and stark oppression, particularly in the case of the&nbsp;education of girls in India. In many regional belts as well as urban areas, several girls are not allowed to attend schools or are required to drop out and take care of the household chores, or even start earning, anything but receive an education. India is a progressive nation but unfortunately, the girl child is still devoid of her basic rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why 24th January is dedicated to celebrating the National Girl Child Day in India, an occasion to spread awareness about the reality behind several underprivileged girls. This day also encourages citizens to support thousands of such young girls by extending useful tools and resources for them to have happier childhoods. Therefore, the best way to commemorate the day is to volunteer with CRY (Child Rights and You) that supports young girls; read on to know how you can accomplish that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.
