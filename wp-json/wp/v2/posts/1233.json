Most of the adolescents in her community were found to be severely anaemic when CRY project PAP conducted a haemoglobin test in collaboration with the Rashtriya Bal Swastha Karikram &#8211; Odisha government\u2019s health department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CRY swung into action and organized a series of sessions on nutrition education with the adolescent girls. They encouraged kitchen gardens that could provide tricolour food and advised increased consumption of drumsticks, papaya, banana and moong as well as regular intake of folic acid and deworming tablets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project staff closely monitored the community\u2019s adherence to these nutrition guidelines and just a year later, when the haemoglobin test was conducted again, Rita\u2019s weight had increased to 34 kgs and her anaemia had been resolved. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rita began to attend school regularly again and today, leads the adolescent girls\u2019 collective to help build awareness on nutrition among other children like her! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Rita the chance at a healthier future.
