When 57 children in a Kanpur government shelter tested positive for Coronavirus, the state government ordered the concerned authorities to test all the children in women and children&#8217;s homes across UP. Mahfooz immediately highlighted the issue at Uttar Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Women &amp; Child Welfare Department as well as the district administration offices of Varanasi and Lucknow. As a result of these advocacy efforts, the Women and Child Welfare department passed a government order ensuring preventive drives for COVID-19 in over 300 homes that house around 5,500 children.<\/p>\n\n<p>After last year, when Mahfooz\u2019s advocacy with the Directorate of Education resulted in children staying in UP homes to access formal education, this is just another small yet significant win for children.
