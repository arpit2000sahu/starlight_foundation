His family could barely make ends meet. So, they pulled him out of school and he began contributing to the household income. While he felt proud of being able to help his parents, Amar often wondered what it\u2019d be like to be able to study like other children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, when CRY held a children\u2019s workshop in his village, Amar decided to go as well. Feeling different from the rest of the child participants, he silently observed as everyone discussed the importance of education. The next day, he surprised everyone by announcing that he has spoken to his parents about not working as a child laborer anymore and would like to continue his education. \u201cEveryone else was more accomplished in studies than me,\u201d he would remark later, \u201cI wanted to study and gain knowledge as well.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t easy, but Amar managed to convince his parents to let him go back to school \u2013 even though it meant losing an earning member of the family. Today, he lives with his uncle in the same village, goes to school regularly, and dreams of pursuing higher education!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Amar the chance at a brighter future.
