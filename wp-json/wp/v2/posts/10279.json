This&nbsp;day&nbsp;is integral, now more than ever, to put out the importance and urgency of&nbsp;vaccination&nbsp;in these overwhelming times of the pandemic. To&nbsp;help&nbsp;prevent the possibility of highly infectious diseases like measles, mumps and tetanus the immunization of&nbsp;children&nbsp;is important. If such diseases are not avoided or treated in time, they can prove to be life-threatening, and even cause death. As per NFHS 4 2016, 38% of&nbsp;children&nbsp;in India (or) 2 out of every 5&nbsp;children&nbsp;in India do not receive complete immunizations. This statistic is startling and needs to get better with time.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>At CRY, we have been working tirelessly to protect&nbsp;children&nbsp;and also to&nbsp;help&nbsp;ensure underserved communities get access to both doses of vaccines, a necessity in these unprecedented times of the pandemic. We are fighting against vaccine hesitancy to ensure&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/ensure-vaccination-of-underserved-communities-nhvd\/\">vaccination\u2002for underserved communities<\/a>&nbsp;is provided and they stay protected from any further potential waves.&nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Unfortunately, due to harsh realities like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cry.org\/blog\/poverty-in-india-affects-underserved-children-in-multiple-ways\/\">poverty in India<\/a>, illiteracy, and a lack of access to resources, many people are still deprived of aids and awareness to protect themselves against a contagious disease like Covid. CRY has been sensitizing communities regarding COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) to&nbsp;help&nbsp;curb the spread of the virus. We have also been spreading awareness to debunk superstitions surrounding tests and infections and address other myths associated with vaccines which, if not addressed, could threaten mass&nbsp;vaccination&nbsp;initiatives.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>CRY, India\u2019s top NGO, is also working closely with local governments and ASHA workers, with the&nbsp;help&nbsp;of its on-ground team, to create awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine through social mobilization and community engagement. Our team is working tirelessly to address the many issues surrounding the COVID vaccine to ensure underserved communities in India overcome vaccine hesitancy and get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>This vaccination day, your contribution to CRY can also help immunize India\u2019s children against deadly diseases and save tax.
