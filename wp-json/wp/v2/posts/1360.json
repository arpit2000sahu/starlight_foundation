Supported by CRY, the two girls have been advocating the importance of education through their singing and public speaking skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jyoti is a gifted singer but doesn&#8217;t just use her skills to entertain others. Instead, she uses her music to promote children&#8217;s education. She first performed a song around the importance of girls at the Bal Mela. Bal Mela is an initiative by CRY where a group of children play, discuss, and share their thoughts, problems, and issues together. There is also a forum to bring their talents to the fore. Since then, Jyoti regularly sings at the community programs, school, and children&#8217;s group events. &#8220;I want to finish my education and become a good singer when I grow up,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sherbano has been advocating the need to finish education through her speeches in places like the Bal Mela, community gatherings, and school events. It was during a school enrolment drive that Sherbano&#8217;s skills came to the fore. Since then, Sherbano has been reciting speeches and spreading awareness in the community on education. She wants to become a scientist like Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam after finishing her education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two girls practice what they preach!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can give more children like Jyoti and Sherbano the chance at a brighter future.
