The silence, exclusion, teasing and shaming affect the girls&#8217; psychological and physical development and hinder their potential big time. The lack of access to basic hygiene facilities and awareness leads to increased dropouts. Girls are often pushed into marriage at an early age once they drop out of school, leading to permanent loss of potential. To help our girls live freely and chase their dreams, we need to end period shame and have open conversations about menstruation.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-3 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"why-children-donate section-bottom-border\">\n<h2 class=\"title-primary sap-heading\">Let&#8217;s start the conversation around periods<\/h2>\n<div><img style=\"width:100%;\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/silence-around-periods.jpg\" alt=\"India\u2019s children\"\/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"why-children-donate section-bottom-border\">\n<div><img src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/period-shame-pledge.png\" alt=\"Period Shame Pledge\"\/><\/div>\n<div class=\"pledge-count\">7873<\/div>\n<h2 class=\"title-primary\">people have already pledged their support to end period shame so far!<\/h2>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-primary hgi-button tp-button\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\">Pledge Now<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"why-children-donate section-bottom-border\">\n<h2 class=\"title-primary\">How can you get involved?<\/h2>\n<p>We must talk about periods openly to break the taboos around them and make women, girls, and everyone else who menstruates feel good about their bodies.
